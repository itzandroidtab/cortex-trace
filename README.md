# Cortex-Trace

Trace support for ARM Cortex-M Microcontrollers. Current features:

* Support for Windows (other OS are not supported currently. Limit is caused by the native module used to communicate with the jlink shared library)
* Live counters

Supports the following hardware:

* J-Trace PRO Cortex-A/R/M
* J-Trace PRO Cortex-M

Older J-Trace tools might be working but are not tested
